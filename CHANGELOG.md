# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Plugin system for data-provider adapters. Each provider now lives in a single folder under `hvantk/skills/<provider>/` with a `plugin.yaml` manifest, builder code, drift probe, downloader CLI, and tests. The loader auto-discovers plugins from the in-tree filesystem and Python entry points.
- `hvantk plugins {list,describe,errors,validate}` commands for inspecting the registry.
- `hvantk drift <provider:dataset>` for upstream-drift detection against committed expected fingerprints.
- `hvantk reprocess <provider:dataset>` for chaining download -> parse -> build -> drift-check from a single command.
- 13 migrated provider plugins: clingen (gene-disease), clinvar, cptac (expression + phospho), expression-atlas, gencc (submissions), gtex-eqtl, gwas-catalog, hgnc, insider, msigdb, peptideatlas (phospho), ucsc-cellbrowser (default / adult-ctx / dev-ctx), uniprot-ptm (sites).
- Scheduled CI workflow (`.github/workflows/drift.yml`) that runs `hvantk drift --all --json` daily and opens a draft PR per drifted plugin with the regenerated fingerprint pre-committed.

### Changed

- Registry keys for migrated providers use compound `provider:dataset` form. Recipe JSONs and any custom callers should update from bare names (e.g., `clinvar`) to compound (`clinvar:variants`). CLI subcommand names (`hvantk mktable clinvar`, etc.) are unchanged for user-facing commands.

### Removed

- Per-provider downloader modules under `hvantk/commands/*_downloader.py` for migrated providers (moved into their plugin folder's `cli.py`).
- Per-provider dataset classes under `hvantk/datasets/*_datasets.py` for migrated providers (moved into `hvantk/skills/<provider>/shared/`).
- Per-provider builder functions in `hvantk/tables/table_builders.py` and `matrix_builders.py` for migrated providers (moved into `hvantk/skills/<provider>/[<dataset>/]builder.py`).

### Known gaps before first stable release

- The following plugins reference snapshot files (`schema.json`, `sample_rows.json`)
  in their `plugin.yaml` manifests that have not yet been seeded on disk:
  `clingen`, `gencc`, `hgnc`, `uniprot-ptm`, `expression-atlas`, `peptideatlas:phospho`,
  `cptac:expression`, and `cptac:phospho`. The first hail-enabled CI run with
  `--regenerate-snapshots` will bootstrap them. All `ucsc-cellbrowser` variants
  (`default`, `adult-ctx`, `dev-ctx`) already have populated snapshot dirs.
